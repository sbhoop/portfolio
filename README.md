# About me
I'm Shashank Bhoop (he/him/his) and I'm a student in the Information Systems program at Heinz and I'll be graduating this December.I like to think of myself as a tech guy who loves simplifying tech for the better. As business and technology don't exist without each other, I look to be the bridge that connects both, and that's what I've done as a business analyst professionaly and what I've learned more about at Carnegie Mellon University. Having used a variety of tools and languages for visualizing data, I believe there is no one super tool and no tool is less (yes, I love Excel). 

To be adept at realizing what tool is best for a task is my aim and to implement a basic ideology of best design practices across my work is my aim, in whatever I do. Once I graduate, I look to make an impact at an organization where I can use these skills.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to get the most information across to the most amount of people in the most efficient manner possible. Confusing charts and graphs have always made lots of information inaccessible to most, and in turn are often misinterpreted. A picture can tell a thousand words but a well thought graph can tell much more. In this busy world I want to be able to communicate my results, research and findings as quickly as possible to get my point across while providing all the information needed. Data always tells a story, and I want to be its illustrator.
