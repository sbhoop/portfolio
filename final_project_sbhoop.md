## Outline

My project aims to dispell the myths that a vegan/vegetarian diet doesn't provide more than enough nutrients to lead a healthy life, while at the same time stressing on the ecological benefits of a vegan/vegetarian diet.

The flow will be of this sort.

A few initial sketches I have will focus on the drawbacks of eating meat, both for us and the environment as well as the benefits from veganism.
